          <h2>Software Development Engineer</h2>
          <p>
          Currently, I work as a Software Development Engineer at HealthWorksAI, where I contribute to building innovative and high-quality user experiences. I specialize in creating visually appealing and responsive web pages using React and JavaScript, with a strong proficiency in Tailwind CSS. I also have a foundational understanding of Node.js, Express, and SQL, which complements my front-end skills and broadens my development capabilities. My attention to detail and logical thinking enable me to produce clean, organized, and maintainable code. I have a good grasp of UX/UI principles, ensuring the interfaces I create are user-friendly and meet the needs of end-users. Additionally, I am adept at working in fast-paced environments, quickly adapting to changing priorities, and collaborating effectively using version control systems like Git. As a self-motivated and creative developer, I am passionate about crafting visually stunning and user-centric web solutions.
